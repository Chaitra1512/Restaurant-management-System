Order Placement and Management: Enables customers to place orders by selecting items from the menu, specifying quantities, and calculates the total bill. Handles user input errors and allows for multiple items to be added to the order.

Order Summary Generation: Generates a detailed summary of the order, including table number, customer name, ordered items, quantities, and total bill. Outputs the summary to both the terminal and a text file for record-keeping.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a command-line interface for ease of use, guiding users through table reservations, menu display, and order placement. Handles input validation and error messages to ensure a smooth user experience.
